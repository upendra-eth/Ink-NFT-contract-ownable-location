# Ink-NFT-contract-ownable-location
I have added ownable and location functionality in erc721 contract so if in case art creater wants manager of contract or company to mannege sale on his behalf. 
Manager will all the cantrol
But it has also a general mint function which mints nft to caller address so we can use contact in every situation
At the time of diployment . Diployer have to give which account he want to make maneger and which will bw admin
By location function i have increased useability of the contract. 
At the the time of minting user can same location of nft on chain... so that now user can difine in which range use of this nft is valid.
