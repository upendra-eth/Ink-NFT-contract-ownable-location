# Ink-NFT-contract-ownable-location
I have added ownable and location functionality in erc721 contract so if in case art creator wants manager of contract or company to manage sale on his behalf. 
Manager will have all the control
But it has also a general mint function which mints nft to caller address so we can use contract in every situation
At the time of deployment . Deployer have to give which account he want to make manager and which will be admin
By location function i have increased usability of the contract. 
At the the time of minting user can same location of nft on chain... so that now user can define in which range use of this nft is valid.
